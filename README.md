## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Martins Berzins

I am a passionate and skilled software developer with expertise in C#, MySQL, GIT, HTML, JavaScript, and TypeScript. I thrive on solving complex problems and creating efficient, scalable solutions. With a keen eye for detail and a commitment to continuous learning, I enjoy tackling new challenges in the ever-evolving world of technology.

Outside of work, I am an avid sports enthusiast who enjoys all kinds of sports, with a special love for basketball and table tennis. When Iâ€™m not coding or playing sports, I cherish spending quality time with my wife and son, making the most of family moments.
